**PostureDetector and Real-Time Sitting Posture Detection**

A real-time AI-powered posture detection MVP built with Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyQt5.  
This project analyzes sitting posture via webcam or video, detecting unhealthy posture such as slouching, forward head posture, shoulder imbalance, and torso leaning.


**Features:**
Real-time posture detection (Webcam + Video input)  
Detects bad sitting posture, not just head angle  
Tracks neck, shoulders, spine, and torso lean  
Stable posture scoring (low noise)  
Live posture feedback (OK / BAD)  
PyQt5 GUI (Desktop App)  
Lightweight & fast (MediaPipe-based)  
Ready for Startup MVP / Industrial prototype



**What This Detects:**
Body Aspect Detection 
Forward Head   
Neck Tilt (Up / Down)  
Head Turn (Left / Right)   
Shoulder Imbalance 
Spine Lean / Slouching  
Torso Forward Bend   
Natural Head Movement Filtering   



**Real Goal:**
Unlike simple posture apps that only measure head angle, this system evaluates real ergonomic sitting posture, focusing on upper spine health and slouch detection.
